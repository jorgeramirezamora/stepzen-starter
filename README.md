# StepZen Starter

## Overview

This is an empty StepZen api project repository. It's useful because it has:

- an index.graphql file ready to add \*.graphql files to
- a sample config.yaml
- a .gitignore with config.yaml set so you don't accidentally check in secrets
- a sample.graphql file with commented out types and queries using various directives and options

1. Install the cli: `npm install -g stepzen`
1. Login with your [account credentials](https://stepzen.com/account): `stepzen login`
